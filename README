An animation modifies a value over time.

The primitive animations (null, linear[fi] and spline) modify a value over the course of 1 unit of time.

There are three ways to modify an animation:
- Modify the rate that time passes within an animation (identity, sinusoid, exponent, reverse).
- Modify the duration of an animation (scale)
- Combine animations (sequence, parallel)
